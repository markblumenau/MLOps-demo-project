# Description

This is a simple project for MLOps course @ HSE MLHLS. Since the main goal of this project is to try out tools like poetry and pre-commit, the DL part is rather lousy.

The task is simple: take data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00203/YearPredictionMSD.txt.zip and train a model on it!
